maven antrun plugin can be used to run ssh and scp command.
Using it, you can do 1 click remote server configuration or deployment.

However, here are some issue I found.
1. When there are "$" characters in your password, you will not pass the ssh authentication.
2. Running command via sudo, you will probably get this error message "sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified".
   To fix it, you need to change sudo configuration on your remote server. Here is the reference link:

   $ sudo visudo
   It will open a edit screen.
   Add this at the LAST LINE. Again, it have to be at the LAST LINE.
   shawn ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   Press Ctrl+O to save the file
   Press Ctrl+X to exit.
   Then, try ssh command again.
